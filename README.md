# IndecisionApp

My first React js App. I created this app while learning react js from Andrew Mead.App is made using react js, webpack,babel,scss.Npm scripts are in package.json

## Description 
It is an basic app,in which you can put a number of daily tasks you wanna do,but you can't decide what to do first  .Currently it stores your data in localstorage using json in browser.
Then you can click on What should i do? button ,and it select an task randomly and give it to you to do.
After that when the task/chore is completed you can remove it from the app,or you can also do remove all.
